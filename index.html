            <h3>Project Title</h3>
            <p>Designed and developed the 'Smart Itinerary Recommender,' a machine learning-based system that analyzes user preferences to recommend personalized travel itineraries. This project enhances the user experience by providing tailored travel suggestions based on inputs like location, budget, and interests. I implemented algorithms such as K-means for grouping similar locations and Apriori for identifying popular combinations of locations or activities. Additionally, the system enables users to track their budget based on selected features, including trip duration, hotel rating, and travel distances.</p>
